> **Note: 2.0.4 not currently available**
>
> Riak version 2.0.4 is not currently available for SUSE due to a known
issue. If you'd like to upgrade Riak, we'd recommend waiting for the
2.0.5 release.

The following steps should get you up and running with Riak on SuSE.

Riak may be installed on the following x86/x86_64 flavors of SuSE:

* SLES11-SP1
* OpenSUSE 11.2
* OpenSUSE 11.3
* OpenSUSE 11.4

The Riak package and all of its dependencies (including the base
Erlang) can be found in an OpenSUSE Build Service
(http://build.opensuse.org) Zypper repository.

The following commands assume that you are running as root.

## Add the Riak Zypper Repository

```bash
zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/database/$distro Riak
```

Where `$distro` is one of:

* `SLE_11_SP1`
* `openSUSE_11.2`
* `openSUSE_11.3`
* `openSUSE_11.4`

> **Note on GPG keys**
>
> The first time you try to use the repository after adding it to your
system, you may be asked to accept the GPG key for the repo.

## Install the Riak Package

```bash
zypper in riak
```

This should automatically pull in the `riak` package's dependencies,
including Erlang if you do not already have it installed.

## Enabling Refresh

You have the option of enabling refresh on the `riak` repository to
receive updates by running the following command:

```bash
zypper mr -r Riak
```

## Next Steps

Now that Riak is installed, check out [Verifying a Riak Installation][install verify].
